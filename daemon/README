This directory contains an experimental gnome-vfs daemon. This daemon is meant to be used by gnome-vfs modules to cache authentication information (username/password). Currently it works with simple test cases, but it probably has bugs and API limitations.

To test it, bonobo-activation needs to be able to find the .server file. Running make install in the daemon directory should be enough for that.

Some future goals may be to integrate it with libgringotts (http://freshmeat.net/redir/libgringotts/33614/url_homepage/index.php), to persist data on disk, ... 

Patching libgnomeui to automatically provide an authentication dialog when a gnome-vfs module requests it would be also really nice for GNOME consistency (all gnome-vfs aware apps would get authentication for free). There is already some stuff to do that in nautilus/eel which might be worth looking at.
