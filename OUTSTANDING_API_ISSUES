Many of these API changes will not make the GNOME2 
timeframe, just be aware that they are possibilites.

Basic recommendations to avoid application breakage:

- Do not use the gnome_vfs_*_uri calls, use the
  non-uri forms instead.

- Do not use the metadata / monitoring APIs without
  first consulting gnome-vfs@ximian.com mailing list
  or being willing to take some breakage if they
  change.

- Do not use gnome-vfs-seekable or gnome-vfs-transform
  unless you consult gnome-vfs@ximian.com. We'd be
  inerested if there's something you actually want to
  use them for.

- Make sure you use pkgconfig to get the correct cflags
  variable, because the include paths may be changing.
