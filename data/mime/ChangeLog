	Fixed bug 7043, java files execute by default now.

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Removed the lines that make compiled java
	execute java by default. We can return to this issue later, along
	with the general issue of how to handle "execute-like" entries in
	this file. Most of the applications have "edit-like"
	behavior. Also removed the line that made the default for opening
	Java source code be the Java compiler. We don't invoke a C
	compiler when you open a C source file and we don't want to do it
	for Java either. Also removed an icon name that doesn't correspond
	to an actual icon.

	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Remove gnorpm from the list of applications,

	Fixed bug 7095 (wrong icon used for HTML files in
	bookmarks & icon views)

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Removed icon for text/html. Nautilus has its
	own logic for dealing with html files that gets broken by a
	hard-wired icon here.  Maybe we should change the logic in
	Nautilus someday, but this is the safe right-before-release
	change.

	More fixes after adding more checks to check-mime.pl.

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Fixed a typo where it said
	"expect_uirs".
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Fixed a couple of places that said
	"default_action" instead of "default_action_type". Got
	rid of some duplicate icon_filename entries. Fixed a few
	places that said "icon-filename".
	* gnome-vfs.mime: Fixed a place that said "regex.2"
	instead of "regex,2". Got rid of some stray "icon_filename".

	Ran check-mime.pl and fixed some of the problems it reported,
	including a bad pattern for application/x-applix-spreadsheet,
	non-translated description for application/qif, and many
	entries that were not in sorted order. Wrote bug reports for

	* gnome-vfs.mime:

	Added four bazillion applications and MIME types so we

	and lots of other random various applications and types.

	* added pico (jpico)

2001-02-07  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* combed mc.keys for missed types, adding:

		application/x-slp
		application/x-tex (a duplicate)

		and dismissing the rest.

	* added a comment to the RPM-detecting magic.

2001-01-31  Rebecca Schulman  <rebecka@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Fixed a typo in this file that was making 
	the vault unviewable by anything except mozilla.

2001-01-31  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.applications: Made check-mime happy by using a tab,
	not spaces, on the realplay line.

2001-01-30  Kenneth Christiansen  <kenneth@gnu.org>

	* gnome-vfs.mime: add abiword abw files.

2001-01-26  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Re-apply many changes that were lost
	when Kenneth created this file. Apparently he made it from

2001-01-22  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 5845 (web bookmarks change to generic document
	icon after visiting)

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:

	Removed all the lines that specify "i-regular" for an
	icon filename. "i-regular" is the default anyway, so 
	specifying it will have no useful effect. In the case
	of bug 5845, it had a bad effect (prevented the special
	web icon from being used). Aaron had intended to make
	this change a while back.

	Note: this bug was marked PR3 so we might want to make this
	simple change on the branched gnome-vfs, if there is one.

2001-01-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Call it a StuffIt archive, not a
	StuffIt! archive. Also get rid of some strangely placed
	blank lines that might have caused some trouble.

2001-01-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Marked text/x-sh as can_be_executable. This was

	* Makefile.am: Fix make rules to put NULL first, use lower-case
	for variables (to match xml-i18n-tools/README recommendations),
	and not repeat the keys files twice in the EXTRA_DIST list. Also,
	remove commented-out obsolete rules.
