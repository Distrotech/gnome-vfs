	* gnome-vfs-mime-magic:
	* gnome-vfs.applications:
	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	* gnome-vfs.mime:
	Got rid of minor whitespace anomalies -- always use tabs to
	indent, don't put any tab on blank lines, no trailing
	whitespace allowed.

2001-01-22  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* removed references to obsolete application/x-abiword
	* added description for text/x-troff-mm
	* added underscore to a couple of plain "description=" lines

2001-01-22  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Rolled in one more change.

2001-01-22  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Re-apply many changes that were lost
	when Kenneth created this file. Apparently he made it from
	and old version of gnome-vfs.keys.

2001-01-22  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	Fixed bug 5845 (web bookmarks change to generic document
	icon after visiting)

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:

	Removed all the lines that specify "i-regular" for an
	icon filename. "i-regular" is the default anyway, so 
	specifying it will have no useful effect. In the case
	of bug 5845, it had a bad effect (prevented the special
	web icon from being used). Aaron had intended to make
	this change a while back.

	Note: this bug was marked PR3 so we might want to make this
	simple change on the branched gnome-vfs, if there is one.

2001-01-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Call it a StuffIt archive, not a
	StuffIt! archive. Also get rid of some strangely placed
	blank lines that might have caused some trouble.

2001-01-19  John Sullivan  <sullivan@eazel.com>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in:
	Marked text/x-sh as can_be_executable. This was
	an oversight from my earlier first pass at marking
	the executable MIME types. It was driving poor Seth crazy.

2001-01-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* Makefile.am: Oops. Missed one.

2001-01-19  Darin Adler  <darin@eazel.com>

	* .cvsignore: Ignore the generated gnome-vfs.keys file.
	* Makefile.am: Fix make rules to put NULL first, use lower-case
	for variables (to match xml-i18n-tools/README recommendations),
	and not repeat the keys files twice in the EXTRA_DIST list. Also,
	remove commented-out obsolete rules.

2001-01-18  Kenneth Christiansen  <kenneth@gnu.org>

	* gnome-vfs.keys.in: Removed some more
	translations. DON'T TRANSLATE THIS FILE ANYMORE
	Get cvs xml-i18n-tools instead and translate
	the pot file localed in po/.

2001-01-18  Kenneth Christiansen  <kenneth@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am: Added support for xml-i18n-tools to
	manage the keys.in file.
	* gnome-vfs.keys: Removed.
	* gnome-vfa.keys.in: Added.

2001-01-16  Christophe Merlet  <redfox@eikonex.org>

	* gnome-vfs.keys: Updated French strings.

2001-01-15  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* revised the english MIME descriptions according to the new rules.

	* added alternate abiword type application/x-abiword
	* standardized translation strategy for "README"
	* obsoleted application/x-class-file in favor of /x-java-byte-code
	* standardized nomenclature for references to troff macro sets
	* removed *.sa mapping to application/x-unix-archive
	* added file regex to map different kinds of ANIM animations

2000-12-28  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* renamed several MIME types to reflect their compressed nature.
	* removed the now-outdated translations of those types.

	* added file extension detection for "compressed" (.Z) files.

2000-12-26  Aaron Brick  <aaron@eazel.com>

	* xmms can support .wav files.
