This is the GNOME Virtual File System.

Do not use it in real projects yet, because it is still at the
experimental stage.

WARNING: If you want to test the GNOME Virtual File System without
installing it, you must run the programs in the `test' directory with
the `vfs-run' wrapper script (which is in the `test' directory as
well).  For example, do:

    ./vfs-run test-sync /etc/passwd

instead of

    ./test-sync /etc/passwd

This will make sure that the VFS modules being used are the ones you
have compiled, instead of the ones installed on the system.
