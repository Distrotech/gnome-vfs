STUFF TO DO
===========

X keywords aren't being pulled from itemdir files.  bug in
  entry_quick_read_keys?

X all pool files are read on startup.  should load when get_keywords is called.

filename uniqueness mess... need use a unique name when writing user-private
files, but need to present the non-unique name to apps.  use a special vfolder
postfix filename probably.

all-applications doesn't work.  probably need to implement this using either 1)
a recursive gnome_vfs_directory_visit over applications:/// or 2) use the pool
files from .vfolder-info, and add an all-applications-all-users (ick) method or
3) see if we can flatten the panel's internal list of applications.

ensure ~/.gnome2/vfolders exists before writing config file

ensure ~/.gnome2/vfolders/<scheme>/ dir exists before writing user-private
changes

<OnlyUnallocated> dir files list duplicates of regularly listed entries, because
the alloc count is not correct for folders that are not yet loaded.

Directory VFolderMonitors relying on stat() (and not FAM) will not pick up new
files.

Add GConf keys for getting .vfolder-info file to use for a given 
scheme (puntable).

Support set/get_file_info of read-only permissions on folders?
