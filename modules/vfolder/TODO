STUFF TO DO
===========

keywords aren't being pulled from itemdir files.  bug in entry_quick_read_keys?

all pool files are read on startup.  should load when get_keywords is called.

filename uniqueness mess... need use a unique name when writing user-private
files, but need to present the non-unique name to apps.  use a special vfolder
postfix filename probably.

all-applications doesn't work.  probably need to implement this using either 1)
a recursive gnome_vfs_directory_visit over applications:/// or 2) use the pool
files from .vfolder-info, and add an all-applications-all-users (ick) method or
3) see if we can flatten the panel's internal list of applications.

ensure ~/.gnome2/vfolders exists before writing config file

ensure ~/.gnome2/vfolders/<scheme>/ dir exists before writing user-private
changes

<OnlyUnallocated> dir files don't seem to resolve correctly

Directory VFolderMonitors relying on stat() (and not FAM) will not pick up new
files.

Add GConf keys for getting .vfolder-info file to use for a given 
scheme (puntable).
