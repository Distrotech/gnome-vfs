The following functions must be implemented by every module:

( this may be seen by searching gnome-vfs-ops.c, gnome-vfs-uri.c
  for method-> ).

	open,
	create,
	get_file_info,
	is_local.

( Checks for the required functions will probably eventualy be located in
  gnome_vfs_method.c:gnome_vfs_method_get, as sanity checks )
